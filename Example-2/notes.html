<H1>Conference Presentation Judo (notes)</H1>

<p>A substantial amount of the sense of this talk is not in the
slides.  This document will try to relate some of the things I said
during the talk itself that might not otherwise be apparent.  It may
also elaborate, amplify, and explain where necessary.</p>

<p>The notes will also explain the jokes, so if you read the notes
without reading the slides first, you'll be getting explanations of
jokes you haven't heard, and none of it will be funny.  So read the
slides before the notes, or concurrently with the notes.</p>

<p>As in the talk itself, everything in these notes is intended
seriously, even when it appears to be facetious.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-1"><a href="slide001.html">Slide 1: Conference Presentation Judo</a></a></h2>

<p>Earlier that morning I had given a talk on <cite>Mailing List
Judo</cite>, which was a tongue-in-cheek guide to the best way to
navigate the social obstacles of the <tt>perl5-porters</tt> mailing
list and to get
your patches to Perl incorporated into the main source.  The 'judo' of
the title referred to the idea that one could use the negative
features of the mailing list against themselves.</p>

<p>That class finished with a slide that said "Come back next year
for my talk on <cite>Conference Presentation Judo</cite>" over a
picture of a happy baby.  (See below for more details about the baby.)  
I was serious about the Conference Presentation Judo talk, and in the
days before the conference I made several pages of notes for it.</p>

<p>Just before I left for the conference, Kevin Lenzo wrote to tell me
there had been a cancellation and to ask if I could fill an extra
slot.  I gave Kevin a choice of five talks, and he chose this one.</p>

<p>The picture on this slide is an extreme closeup of my face.
Observant viewers sometimes remark that it's unusual that my pupil is
so dilated even though it appears that I'm looking directly into a
light.  When this picture was taken I had just returned from the
ophthalmologist, who had forcibly dilated my pupil so he could look
in.  </p>

<h2><a name="sl-2"><a href="slide002.html">Slide 2: Conference Presentations</a></a></h2>

<p>The talk was aimed primarily at people who will be giving a
three-hour tutorial at a conference like TPC or Usenix.  Many people
have told me that  they think it will be helpful to them in preparing
talks of other lengths for other venues.</p>

<p>Several former TPC tutorial speakers were in the room.  Also
present was Robert Spier, who was scheduled to give his first TPC
tutorial the following month.  I had originally been scheduled to
speak at the same time as Robert, but I had my talk moved so that
Robert could attend.</p>

<p>I really do believe that most tutorial speakers are terrible.
One of the perks of doing a tutorial is that you get to attend the
other tutorials for free.  I rarely last through more than half an
hour of anyone else's tutorial.  Partly this is just a short attention
span, and partly it's that I pick things up much quicker than the
typical student.  But a lot of it is that the tutorials are very
poorly organized and presented.</p>

<p>Readers should note that this talk is about tricks that might not
be obvious and advice you haven't heard before---I'm not going to
explain the fundamentals of public speaking, such as "always face the
audience."  This talk assumes you've heard that already.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-3"><a href="slide003.html">Slide 3: Conference Presentations</a></a></h2>

<p>This slide originally carried a picture of Damian.  I took it out
before the conference because I decided that it didn't make any
important point except to reveal one of the more unpleasant sides of
my personality.</p>

<p>Both Damian and my wife agreed that it was funny, so here it
is:</p>

<p align=center><img src="conway-tooth.jpg"></p>

<h2><a name="sl-4"><a href="slide004.html">Slide 4: The Biggest Mistake You Can Make</a></a></h2>

<p>On the previous slide, I considered mentioning that one of the ways
in which some people fail to have apititude for tutorial presentation
is to have a small bladder.  I was blessed with an enormous bladder,
which is a valuable asset.  I was going to put a picture of a bladder
on the slide.  I decided against the whole thing because I didn't want
to telegraph the joke that appears on <i>this</i> slide.</p>

<p>After the talk, Damian and I were discussing these slides, and
Damian congratulated me on the clever visual pun in the illustration.</p>

<p>I said, "What pun?"</p>

<p>"Well, of course, she's just bowing."</p>

<p>"No, she isn't."</p>

<p>"What's she doing, then?"</p>

<p>"She's doing exactly what the slide is about."</p>

<p>"Ugggggh."</p>

<p>I agree, it would have been very clever to think of using a picture
of someone who was merely bowing.  It never occurred to me.  My
approach to things is more blunt and direct than that.
</p>

<h2><a name="sl-5"><a href="slide005.html">Slide 5: The Second Biggest Mistake You Can
Make</a></a></h2>

<p>As far as I know, I have never done this.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-6"><a href="slide006.html">Slide 6: The Biggest Mistake You Can Make</a></a></h2>

<p>I have nothing in particular to say about this slide, so I'll
address a couple of issues I forgot to mention in the talk.  In a talk
of longer than about twenty minutes, you should really have some water
handy.  You can get into big trouble if your mouth dries out in the
middle.  Obviously, it can become difficult to continue talking.  Even
worse, some people have the problem that if they try to talk with an
insufficiently lubricated mouth, their spit tends to fly around a
lot.  Ick.</p>

<p>The converse of this, however, is that you should be careful not to
drink too much unless you're one of those lucky people like me who
doesn't have to care.  I usually go through about a quart and a half
of water in a 90-minute talk, but not everyone can do this.  Ration
your water supply unless you're sure you can handle it all.  Don't try
this at home folks; I'm a trained professional. </p>

<p>Do <i>not</i> try to drink coffee while you're talking.  This is for
several reasons.  First and most obviously, the caffeine is a
diuretic.  But more important, coffee is a lot more viscous than water
is, and if you try to drink and talk at the same time, you are likely
to inhale some.  Stick to water.</p>

<p> Similarly, it's probably a good idea to avoid eating while
talking.  The problems here are manifold and obvious: You might choke.
You might spray food particles around.  You might become impossible to
understand.  You might inadvertently let the audience see the food
after you've chewed it but before you've swallowed it.  (Ick.)  Like
all the advice in this talk, this must be adjusted for each person.
Even with all these potential problems, I eat during my morning talks
anyway.  Why?  Because if I don't eat, I get cranky and irritable
around 11 AM, and then I start to tell audience members how stupid
they are, and that's worse than letting them view my semi-chewed
breakfast.  You have to work with what you have.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-7"><a href="slide007.html">Slide 7: The Single Biggest Mistake You Can Make</a></a></h2>

<p>The advice on this slide is crucial, and not at all obvious without
the explanation, which I delivered orally.</p>

<p>The reason you <i>must</i> not discharge the class early or late
for break is this:  If you let them out them early, the hotel staff
will not yet have finished setting up the coffee and cake service.  If
you discharge them late, the other classes will already have eaten up
the best cakes.  The cakes are the high point of the tutorial for many
people, and if you screw up the cake schedule, you will be savaged on
the evaluations.  People love cake.  </p>

<p>The picture illustrates this, showing me in the act of enjoying a
Sacher Torte.  My in-laws sent this to us from the Hotel Sacher in Vienna.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-8"><a href="slide008.html">Slide 8: On Content</a></a></h2>

<p>This section intentionally left blank.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-9"><a href="slide009.html">Slide 9: On Content</a></a></h2>

<p>This is one of those slides where I was afraid that people would
think I was being facetious.  I wasn't.  Gilbert Highet says
much the same thing in <cite>The Art of Teaching</cite>.   A talk with
good presentation and poor content beats one with good content and
poor presentation.  This is because the first talk will at least pass
the time amusingly; the second will be a deadly bore and you won't
learn anything anyway.</p>

<p>Of course, the trick is to have good presentation <i>and</i> good
content.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-10"><a href="slide010.html">Slide 10: On Content</a></a></h2>

<p>By the way, I recommend <cite>The Art of Teaching</cite> very
highly.  And here's an interesting phenomenon: If you look at the
Amazon customer reviews of it, you find that everyone agrees that it's
great except for M.Ed. students in Missouri and northwestern
Illinois.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-11"><a href="slide011.html">Slide 11: On Content</a></a></h2>

<h2><a name="sl-12"><a href="slide012.html">Slide 12: On Content</a></a></h2>

<p>Apparently when I got to the "Introduction to XML" slides, a
gentleman in the audience turned pale.  He got out his laptop, brought
up the slides for his own "Introduction to XML" class, and they
matched my fake slides almost exactly.</p>

<p>Despite this, I swear that the assertion on slide 14 is true:  I
was not thinking of any specific instructor or class.  I just chose
XML as an unusually boring and buzzword-ridden example.</p>

<p>The truth is, the problem of long pointless introductions in
tutorials is almost universal.  Nearly everyone does it.<p>

<p>This was exactly the reason that I started the <a href="http://perl.plover.com/lt/">Lightning Talks
sessions</a>.  I decided that if the speakers couldn't get to the point
promptly, then dammit, I was going to <i>force</i> them to get there
or else get off the stage.  It has worked pretty well.  Every year has
a couple of people who can't seem to say anything, but I get rid of
them quickly.</p>

<p>Voltaire once wrote "I am sorry that this letter was so long, but I
did not have time to make it shorter."  To prepare good talks or
articles, authors must ask themselves "What am I really trying to say
here?  Why is it important?"  The severe constraint of a five-minute
time limit forces a distillation of thought and a clarity of
exposition not usually found in longer talks.</p>

<p>Some day I'll write an essay on the theme "Constraint is
liberating."</p>

<p>Some time ago <a href="http://use.perl.org/~gnat/journal/3732">Nat
Torkington pointed</a> to a <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2002/03/19/megnut.html">discussion of conference design</a>
which criticized 45-minute sessions as too short.  This article said,
in part:</p>

<blockquote><p>
Last fall at the O'Reilly P2P & Web Services Conference I noticed that
the short sessions (45 minutes) prevented every relevant point from
being addressed and discussed.
</p></blockquote>

<p>The author of the article apprently considers this a disadvantage.
To me, it seems like a benefit.</p>

<blockquote><p>
Panels and sessions served as
instigators of discussions that continued in the hall afterwards, or
over lunch in the courtyard.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Also an advantage, in my opinion if not the author's.  Having
conference attendees come up to a microphone to ask questions
discourages dialogue; encourages a hierarchy of authority; discourages
networking; encourages thoughtlessness.  Having conference attendees
meet the speakers in the hallway or over lunch does the opposite.  The
participants can have a meaningful exchange of complex ideas,
conversing as equals, instead of being forced into the roles of
supplicant and hierophant.</p>

<p>And, of course, having long conference sessions encourages a lot of
blather.</p>

<p>Nat asked folks for feedback on this, and I said:</p>

<blockquote><p>
I'm sure my opinion won't be a surprise, but I think that even
45-minute sessions are too long for most speakers.  If you give them
any more time, they just waste it.  If they want to talk for twice as
long, let them cut the talk in half and send two proposals.</p>

<p>
TPC used to have groups of three related 20-minute talks scheduled
into a one-hour slot.  I liked those.  If I were scheduling a
conference, my motto would be "twenty is plenty."</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a name="sl-15"><a href="slide015.html">Slide 15: The Long Introduction</a></a></h2>

<h2><a name="sl-16"><a href="slide016.html">Slide 16: The Long Introduction</a></a></h2>

<p>This slide raises a question that's puzzled me for a long time: Why
do people attend these three-hour lectures anyway?  I talked with
Conway about this once, and he had some useful things to say, and
pointed out that for many people, the lecture really is a good way to
learn a few things. Still, I think these classes are far from optimal.
You know, if you can get six people together who want one of these
classes, you can pay me to come to where you are and give the class
just for you, and you'll get a lot more out of it than if you paid to
sit in a giant room with two hundred other people and hear a lecture.
If you get seven people, they'll get a better class <i>and</i> save
money.  If you get twelve people, they'll save a <i>lot</i> of money.
I don't know why more people don't do this.</p>

<p>I'm afraid some people interpreted my remark about 45-minute
attention spans to be vaguely insulting to conference attendees.  But
it was certainly not intended that way.  Really <i>nobody</i> can pay
attention for more than about 45 minutes.  Certainly I can't, and I
have unusual powers of concentration.</p>

<p>I guess that the standard deviation of attention span is about 15
minutes, so that about 2/3 of the audience gets distracted by the end
of the first hour.  </p>

<h2><a name="sl-17"><a href="slide017.html">Slide 17: A Bit of Advice</a></a></h2>

<p>At this point I asked for a show of hands to learn how many people had
heard this advice.  Most of them had.</p>

<p>It's amazing that this awful advice has such a hold on people.  If
you contrast the traditional advice with my advice, it seems to me
that mine sounds a lot more commonsensical.  You're giving a technical
talk; the attendees have gone to a lot of trouble and expense to be
there.  What could be more natural than "Get to the point"?</p>

<p>One of the things that playwrights learn is that if you want the
audience to remember something, you have to tell them three times.
That's true.  But that doesn't mean that they should be told three
times in exactly the same way---A playwright who tried to do that
would die in the gutter, and so will you.</p>

<p>That brings us to the third piece of advice ("Don't repeat;
embellish"), which requires a little elaboration.  You want to present
each important idea more than once, because a lot of the audience
won't really get it after the first example.  So you show a second,
different example, which has an interesting variation.  The people who
didn't fully grasp the concept the first time around now have an
opportunity to see it again.  The people who <i>did</i> get it the
first time around will remain alert and interested because of the
variation.  </p>

<p>Here's an example.  I want to convert a recursive function to an
iterator.  One example is a directory tree walker.  A later example is
a genomic sequence generator.  (Given a pattern like
<tt>&lt;CGA&gt;TT&lt;CG&gt;TT</tt>, produce strings like
<tt>CTTCTT</tt>, <tt>GTTCTT</tt>, <tt>ATTCTT</tt>, <tt>CTTGTT</tt>,
...)  Structurally, these are quite similar.  But the tree walker
involves some system programming details, while the sequence generator
involves some parsing details.  breadth-first and depth-first search
both yield sensible results for directory trees, but only depth-first
search makes sense for the sequences.  With the sequences, a random
search order can be interesting, so I introduce that as a variation.
People who didn't understand the details of the tree walker get to see
them over again, and people who did understand it get to compare the
two examples and ponder the differences.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-18"><a href="slide018.html">Slide 18: Get to the Point</a></a></h2>

<p>Notice that this <i>one slide</i> is the "introduction
<b>section</b>". </p>

<p>The list of examples is rather devious.  "Generating DNA sequences"
is there because everyone knows that Perl was important for the Human
Genome Project and the bioinformatics is a major research area, funded
by the government and so on.  If iterators are useful in
bioinformatics, they therefore have some importance in the real
world.</p>

<p>"Database searches" is there to convince the people who weren't
convinced by bioinformatics.  It's completely generic and completely
universal.  Every single person in the room has to perform database
searches.  It's also there because it's boring.  Some people refuse to
believe that anything interesting has any real value, so I always try
to include an example from cost accounting if I can.  Databases aren't
as dull as cost accounting, but they're dull enough.</p>

<p>"Permutations" is there to hook the math-heads and academics.  It's
also there to impress people who don't know what permutations are but
who are impressed by big words.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-19"><a href="slide019.html">Slide 19: Get to the Point</a></a></h2>

<p>The thing to notice here is how quickly I dive into the technical
details.  Slide 1 is the introduction section.  Slide 2 introduces a
specific problem we're going to solve.  Slide 3 shows complete code;
slides 4-5 explain how it works.  Slide 6 presents the problems with
the approach.  Slides 7-9 show that these same problems appear in the
context of permutation generation (the 'solution' in the <cite>Perl
Cookbook</cite> has the same severe defects) and database search.
Having established that these are common problems, I then show the
solution: Slide 10-12 introduces the solution in the context of
databases, because Perl's <tt>DBI</tt> module provides a ready-made
example.  Slide 12 ends by calling the solution structure an
<i>iterator</i>; slide 13 backs up and answers the question "What is
an iterator?"  Now that the class has seen several examples of the
problem we're solving, and one well-known example that uses iterators
as a solution, they're ready to appreciate why they might <i>care</i>
about the answer to the question "What is an iterator?".</p>

<p>Even if someone falls asleep after 45 minutes, they will know what
iterators are for and have several examples of places where they are
used and places where it would be a good idea to use them.  They have
an analogy with filehandles, which are a special case, and Perl's
'each' and 'readdir' operators, ditto.  They don't know any techniques
for implementing iterators, because I showed those after they fell
asleep, but the code is still in the book and they can read it later.
Mission accomplished.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-20"><a href="slide020.html">Slide 20: Pictures</a></a></h2>

<p>I think this may be the single best slide I've ever made.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-21"><a href="slide021.html">Slide 21: Illustrations</a></a></h2>

<p>Pictures don't have to be irrelevant or colorful.  Even a
monochrome box-and-arrow diagram breaks up the monotony of slide after
slide of unrelenting text.</p>

<p>The atrocious pun here is that this was the illustration from the
first page of a tutorial section on "autoloading".</p>



<h2><a name="sl-22"><a href="slide022.html">Slide 22: Illustrations</a></a></h2>

<p>This year I redid all my diagrams.  I felt like a complete dumbass
for having taken so long to figure this out.</p>

<img src="Randal.jpg" align=right>

<h2><a name="sl-23"><a href="slide023.html">Slide 23: Illustrations</a></a></h2>

<p>Meng tells me that magazine designers follow the same rule.  If
they have a picture of a person, they will flip it over if necessary
to get the person to be looking at the gutter instead of at the
margin.  I boastfully note that I figured this out for myself.</p>

<p>I wish I had used a better example person on this slide; I don't
know why I went with Amelia Earhart.  These notes show a better
example.  I use this picture of Randal Schwartz every chance I get
because Randal appears to be so interested in the text.</p>

<br clear=right>

<h2><a name="sl-24"><a href="slide024.html">Slide 24: Illustrations</a></a></h2>

<p>Here we see a piece of useful advice: Everyone loves a happy baby.
It's shameful to use such a dirty trick, but I didn't let my shame
prevent me from using it three times at that conference.  Hey, it's a
dog-eat-dog world out there and if I can make more money by exploiting
innocent babies, that's what I will do.</p>

<p>I found this picture by doing a <a
href="http://images.google.com/">Google image search</a> for 
"<a href="http://images.google.com/images?q=happy+baby">happy baby</a>".  I
got thirty thumbnails of the thirty happiest babies you've ever seen.</p>

<p>Appeal to base psychology whenever possible.  People are wired to
love happy babies.  People are wired to think that fruit beautiful.
People are wired to feel disgust at the sight of shit and vomit.  If
you want people to be disgusted by C++, putting some turds on the page
is the most effective thing you can do.  People will feel real
disgust, not in the front part of their brains, but way at the back,
in the microcode.  (I probably don't need to list all the ways this
plan could backfire, do I?)
</p>

<h2><a name="sl-25"><a href="slide025.html">Slide 25: Speed</a></a></h2>

<p>Everyone in the class wishes you would go at a different speed.
Some people want you to go faster, some slower.  On this slide,
"median rate" means a rate which is faster than half the audience
would most prefer and slower than the other half would most prefer.
While this is the speed that's closest to everyone's preference, it's
not optimal.</p>

<p>By '75-80% mark' I mean that I try to run my classes at a speed
that is faster than 75-80% of the people in the class would most
prefer.</p>

<p>Since hardly anyone will retain everything in your talk, you want
to construct the talk in sections that are as independent as possible.
The way to do that is to structure the talk like a tree.  Graphs with
cycles have more dependencies.  You should cover the root nodes first
because everything else depends on them and at the beginning of the
talk everyone is still awake for it.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-26"><a href="slide026.html">Slide 26: Speed</a></a></h2>

<p>At a 75-80% speed, people will miss stuff; it will go by too fast
for them to understand.  But that was going to happen anyway.</p>

<p>The thing about synchronization points is very important.  It's all
very well to imagine your talk as the development of a single
brilliant argument from start to finish, but if you do it that way,
almost nobody will follow the whole thing.  It's better to break the
talk into sections that can be swallowed one at a time.  Then if
someone sleeps through section 7 and wakes up for section 8, they
still get some value out of section 8, and they can use their
knowledge of section 8 later on when they go back and try to reread
the notes for section 7.</p>

<p>I guess the short version of all this is: If you have sections, you
can go faster.  The slower people will learn more because they can get
some of the sections on the first pass and fill in the missing
sections later; the faster people will learn more because you went
faster. </p>

<h2><a name="sl-27"><a href="slide027.html">Slide 27: The Guy in the Second Row</a></a></h2>

<p>My original plan for this talk was going to have "Seven Conference
Attendees to Watch Out For", but the only one I could think of was the
Guy in the Second Row.  I do not know why he always sits in the second
row.   He's not always a guy; I had a female Guy in the Second Row once.</p>

<p>My life has been  full of Guys in the Second Row,  but I had a very
specific person  in mind when  I wrote this slide.   Originally, there
was a picture of him on the  slide.  Then I decided it was unfair, and
added a note about how the person on slide 28 was actually much worse.
Then I took the original person off of slide 27 and just went with the
slide 28 person.</p>

<p>About two minutes before I was due to give the talk I discovered
that the version of the slides I had handy was an older version that
had the unfair version of slide 27.  Fortunately I was able to
download the updated version in time.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-28"><a href="slide028.html">Slide 28: The Guy in the Second Row</a></a></h2>

<p>This is a picture of me.  This would probably have been more
obvious if you had been at the talk.</p>

<p>Once I recognized the phenomenon of guy-in-the-second-row-ism, it
didn't take me long to figure out that I was one of them.  This is
probably why I find Second-Row-ism so darn annoying.  The faults we
dislike most in others are those that remind us most of our own
faults.</p>

<p>For a typical example, listen to <a
href="http://www.perl.org/yapc/2002/audio/turoff-openpresentation.wav.mp3">Adam
Turoff's talk on open source presentation systems</a>.


<h2><a name="sl-29"><a href="slide029.html">Slide 29: Questions</a></a></h2>

<p>I got this idea from <a
href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/">Phil Agre</a>.
Unfortunately I can't find his original remarks.  But almost
everything Phil writes is worth reading, so have a look around his
site.  In particular, <a
href="http://dlis.gseis.ucla.edu/people/pagre/network.html"><cite>Networking
on the Network</cite></a> contains useful advice for how to get the
most out of a conference.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-30"><a href="slide030.html">Slide 30: Accordion Sections</a></a></h2>

<p>If you run out of time on slide 111 of 120, the evaluations will
complain that you didn't finish the talk.  But if you run out of time
on slide 120 after having skipped slides 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113,
115, 117, and 119, nobody will complain at all.  Go figure.</p>

<p>So, for example, my <cite>Tricks of the Wizards</cite> class ends
with:</p>


<table bordercolor=white>
<tr><th>Topic</th><th># slides</th></tr>
<tr><td>Returning a False Value</td><td>2</td></tr>

<h2><a name="sl-31"><a href="slide031.html">Slide 31: The Bonus Section</a></a></h2>

<p>Conference attendees like to see a big fat book.  It makes them
feel like they got their money's worth, even if most of the book is
crap.  After the conference is over and they've forgotten the
tutorial, they still have the book, which proves to them (and their
boss) that they were exposed to education.</p>

<p>One implication of this is that people will be happier if you
print on only one side of each page; this makes the book twice as
thick.  It also gives the attendees a convenient place to make notes.
(On the other hand, if your slides don't have space for notes already,
you probably have too much text on the slides.)  The big downside is
that one-sided printing wastes trees.  </p>

<p>An easy way to bulk out the book is to attach a bunch of technical
specs such as RFCs.  The Bonus Section approach is more valuable and
interesting.  Even a small Bonus Section is worth having.</p>

<p>Calling it a "bonus section" instead of "random crap that I almost
threw away" makes it sound like a benefit (which it is) instead of a
liability. </p>

<p> Nearly everyone seems to have the problem of having too much
material rather than too little.  After you spend a lot of work
writing up your slides, you don't like to cut them out and throw them
away.  You want people to see the results of your hard work.  The
result is that the class is too long and bloated. Having a bonus
section makes it psychologically easier to chop stuff out of the
class.  You don't have to consign it to the trash can; it will go in
the Bonus Section.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-32"><a href="slide032.html">Slide 32: The Bonus Section</a></a></h2>

<h2><a name="sl-33"><a href="slide033.html">Slide 33: Digressions</a></a></h2>

<p>People attending my <a href="http://perl.plover.com/yak/path/"><cite>Stolen Secrets of
the Wizards of the Ivory Tower</cite></a>  class at YAPC this year
will note that I didn't follow my own advice here.  I digressed
extensively in the middle of a discussion of memoization to discuss <a
href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/iso-paper.html">ISO paper
formats</a>.  A brief digression would have been acceptable.  It
probably would have been better to stick to the subject.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-34"><a href="slide034.html">Slide 34: Evaluations</a></a></h2>

<p>The evaluations may be worthless, but that's what the conference
staff uses to decide whom to invite back next year, so you need to get
good ones.  That's why this talk is all about making sure your class
gets the best cakes.</p>

<p>Remember, unless at least sixty percent of the class says you're
going too fast, then you're going too slow.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-35"><a href="slide035.html">Slide 35: Evaluations</a></a></h2>

<p>Good advice for this life in general.  You can't count on getting
approval or encouragement from other people, so concentrate on geting
approval from yourself.  </p>

<p>I sometimes imagine myself standing in judgement before God.  God
asks me, "Did you do the best job you could?"  I want to be able to
say that I did.  If I can imagine telling God that I did good work,
then that's good enough for me.  If God is happy with my talk, then
the conference attendees should be satisfied too.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-36"><a href="slide036.html">Slide 36: Jokes</a></a></h2>

<p>If you <i>do</i> begin with a joke, it must be a <i>relevant</i>
joke.  You can't win the audience by starting off with "A priest and a
rabbi were fishing..."</p>

<p>This talk started with a couple of jokes.   They were very successful.
Bathroom humor may be juvenile, but it's universal. People are
less offended by it than I thought they might be.  The same caveat
applies here, though:  If you aren't a bathroom humor sort of person,
then stay away from bathroom humor.  I think one reason I can get away
with it is that there's no coyness on my nature.</p>

<p>The advice on this slide has a more general version:  Don't take
any advice that is contrary to your nature, including the advice in
this talk.  If you're not a cynical, manipulative bastard, or if you
hate babies, you might
want to avoid pictures of happy babies.  If pictures aren't working
for you, maybe you shouldn't have them.  There's probably even someone
out there who can't give the best possible talk unless they sabotage
the cake schedule. </p>

<p>This reminds me of a very clever suggestion that Meng made a few
weeks ago.  In one of my talks, I have a picture of two-headed
sperm:</p>

<p align=center><img src="http://perl.plover.com/yak/flags/sperm.jpg"></p>

<p>I was initially worried that some people might be offended by this
picture.  Meng's suggestion was that if anyone was offended, to tell
them that it was a picture of gorilla sperm, which would make it all
right.</p>

<p>This is very funny, but only because it's true.</p> 

<h2><a name="sl-37"><a href="slide037.html">Slide 37: Friendly Faces</a></a></h2>

<p>I like to get Kurt Starsinic primarily because he's friendly
looking.  Kurt has an unusually honest, open-looking face.  He also
smiles a lot.</p>

<p>Incidentally, if you do have trouble with stage fright, here's a
trick that worked well for me for a long time.  I found that playing
the harmonica in the bathroom before the talk was very helpful.
Partly this is because it's distracting, and partly because it forces
deep, rhythmic breathing.  I don't expect you to run out and learn to
play the harmonica, but the advice about distractions and deep
breathing applies to everyone.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-38"><a href="slide038.html">Slide 38: Friendly Faces</a></a></h2>

<p>This is Placido the octopus.   My wife and I have several octopuses
at home, but Placido is the one who accompanies me to all my talks.
Some people would probably to bring prefer a bear or a doggie.</p>

<p>Placido was named after <a
href="http://www.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/stl/team/stl_player_bio.jsp?club_context=mlb&playerid=135784">Placido
Polanco</a>, a utility infielder for the St. Louis Cardinals.  After
YAPC was over, Placido and I went to the Cardinals game and were
delighted to discover Polanco playing third base.  (I had completely
forgotten that Polanco played for St. Louis.)  He was two for four
with a double, scoring one run and driving in two.  The Cardinals beat
the Reds 3-2.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-39"><a href="slide039.html">Slide 39: Small Change</a></a></h2>

<p>It's a good idea in general to keep your hands out of your pockets
while you're speaking.  If nothing else, it projects nervousness.  If
your pockets are full of change, you'll jingle it, which will annoy
the people who can hear; to the people who can't hear it will appear
that you are fondling your genitals.  If there isn't any change in
your pocket, you may fondle unconsciously.  All of this is very
bad.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-40"><a href="slide040.html">Slide 40: Insults</a></a></h2>

<p>I'm not sure that this is actually good advice.  It might be better
to live your life without ever speaking ill of anyone.  Sorry, I'm not
yet a perfect sage.</p>

<p>In any case, if you're a seething cauldron of bile like me, and you
just can't restrain yourself from insulting <i>someone</i>, then
telling your audience that they're smarter than last week's audience
seems like a reasonably safe escape route.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-41"><a href="slide041.html">Slide 41: Proofreading</a></a></h2>

<p>This is the thing about audiences that drives me the most bananas.
Why do they have to be so uppity about little typos?  But they are,
and I've had to learn to live with it.  When God asks me if I did my
work as well as I could, I don't want to have to admit that my slides
were full of typos.</p>

<p>If I were going to write an essay about how to give a good talk,
the practice session would be the most important thing on the list
after going to the bathroom beforehand.  The practice session gives
you a chance to find out what's unclear.  The practice session gives
you a chance to find out whether your first draft is fifty percent too
long or only twenty percent.  If you find yourself waving your arms a
lot at certain points in the practice session, that tells you that you
should add diagrams to the slides at those points.  In the middle of
the practice session, you can stop and take notes about how to improve
the slides.  Practice sessions are more informal, so you won't be as
scared and the audience will be more forgiving.</p>

<p>You can make some money by charging people five or ten bucks to
come to the practice session; the attendees will be glad of the chance
to get a $300 tutorial for $10. This also gets you valuable exposure,
and people will leave feeling that you did them a big favor,
especially if you spend some of the admission fees on making a handout
to give them.  Everyone comes out happy.</p>

<p>Incidentally, this slide demonstrates that even the simplest
illustration is better than no illustration at all.  I think the giant
comma is hilarious.</p>

<h2><a name="sl-42"><a href="slide042.html">Slide 42: Biggest Mistake I Ever Made</a></a></h2>

<p>Good conference presentation wear is slacks and a button shirt with
a collar.  You must look tidy and confortable.  If a collar shirt will
make you uncomfortable, you must wear something else, because nobody
likes to sit for three hours and watch a speaker who looks like he is
being garrotted.  I always roll up the sleeves of my shirt, which may
be untidy, but otherwise the sleeves bother me.  Also, I like the way
it looks, and for me, it's important to feel that I'm physically
attractive when I give a talk.</p>

<p>Wearing suits does not make me uncomfortable---sometimes I wear
mine just for fun---but it sure does make conference attendees
uncomfortable.  I was slammed on the evaluations for the suit.  People
were quite offended that I would dare appear before them in a suit.
Geeks are very anti-suit.  I don't think this is a good thing; I think
it reflects an underlying insecurity and lack of self-knowledge.  A
suit is just clothes; putting one on doesn't change you into a
different person.  But most geeks don't seem to be comfortable enough
with their own identities to feel safe dressing differently than usual.</p>

<p>Back before I was completely comfortable with the idea of wearing a
suit, I explained it to myself by saying that I was in disguise,
sneaking around deviously undercover, and that made me feel better.
After a little while I got used to it.  I think it's a bad sign that
so many geeks are so frightened by the very thought of a suit.</p>


<h2><a name="sl-43"><a href="slide043.html">Slide 43: Thank You</a></a></h2>

<p>Always say 'thank you' at the end.  That's just ordinary
manners.</p>

<p>Thank you.  I hope you found this helpful.</p>
